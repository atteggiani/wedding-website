    For guests traveling from abroad, we recommend staying in <strong>Rome</strong> for the days leading up to the wedding, so you can enjoy the city and make the most of your trip.
    
    For the night of the wedding (2-3 September) we suggest booking accommodation <strong>near Torre Ubaldo</strong>, as the celebration is expected to conclude between 12:00 AM and 2:00 AM.
    
    Several accommodation options are available in <strong>Cisterna di Latina</strong> or in the nearby town of <strong>Latina</strong> (Davide's hometown!). Both are just a short drive from the wedding venue and offer a variety of <strong>hotels and Airbnb options</strong>.
